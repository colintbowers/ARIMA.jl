# ARIMA

This package includes all the code in my [RARIMA](https://github.com/colintbowers/RARIMA.jl.git) package that does not depend on the [R language](http://www.r-project.org/) via [RCall](https://github.com/JuliaStats/RCall.jl). This means that currently, this package only contains the ability to simulate ARIMA models and provide point forecasts of ARIMA models. For estimation, and forecasts with confidence bounds, the RARIMA package (and thus a dependency on R) is still necessary. Hopefully, this package will one day contain all the functionality of RARIMA, at which point RARIMA will no longer be needed.

For information on how to use this package, simply refer to the docs for [RARIMA](https://github.com/colintbowers/RARIMA.jl.git).
